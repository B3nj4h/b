## Spectrum
Scotland yard have intercepted information about one of the biggest drug deals to go down in the city of London. Can you find out where and when the deal is expected to go down? 

##  What time is the meeting happening? (4 points) 

We mount the image with kpartx to access the content
```bash
sudo kpartx -a -v image.dd
```

```bash
❯ strings 00048900.jpg | less
JFIF
Exif
steghide password: cheese on toast
#F      z'
P2NC
```

## What are the supposed coordinates for the deal? (4 points) 

We use john to crack the zip file and find the password is garfield
```bash
❯ zip2john noise_samples.zip > noise_samples.txt
```
```bash
❯ john -w=/usr/share/dict/rockyou.txt noise_samples.txt

We use sonic visualizer to analyze the wav files. We find the white.wav has the coordinates when we change the layer to spectrogram in sonic visualizer
