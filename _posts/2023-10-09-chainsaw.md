## Chainsaw
Rapidly Hunt and Search Through Windows Event Logs.Chainsaw is a command-line tool that provides a fast method of running [Sigma rule](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) detection logic over event log data to highlight suspicious entries. Chainsaw also contains built-in logic for detection use-cases that are not suitable for Sigma rules, and provides a simple interface to search through event logs by keyword, regex pattern, or for specific event IDs

## Common Event Log ID
