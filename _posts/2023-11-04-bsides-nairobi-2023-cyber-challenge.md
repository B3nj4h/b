### Daily blatha
Every day blatha. One part here, another there.
#### You got all my journals? (150pts) 
Use frida to get the name of the app or any other way 
```bash
b3nj4h@arch ~> frida-ps -aU
 PID  Name               Identifier               
----  -----------------  -------------------------
6010  Email              com.android.email        
6386  Google Play Store  com.android.vending      
5402  Messaging          com.android.messaging    
5975  Phone              com.android.dialer       
5632  Superuser          com.genymotion.superuser 
6254  dailyblatha        com.bsidesnrb.dailyblatha
```
we spawn the firebase activity with activity manager 
```bash
am start -n com.bsidesnrb.dailyblatha/.firebaseActivity
Starting: Intent { cmp=com.bsidesnrb.dailyblatha/.firebaseActivity }
```
The app has insecure logging

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/8.png)

We try to grep for BSidesNRB using logcat inside the AVD
```bash
logcat | grep -i BSidesNRB
```
and we get the first piece of the flag
```bash
11-04 06:52:19.517  6254  6254 D BSidesNRB: Value is: BSidesNBI{4ndro1d
```
Next we open the sqlite activity to spawn the database
```bash
am start -n com.bsidesnrb.dailyblatha/.sqliteActivity  
Starting: Intent { cmp=com.bsidesnrb.dailyblatha/.sqliteActivity }
```

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/10.png)

The database is initialize we pull it since we know the name
```bash
adb pull /data/data/com.bsidesnrb.dailyblatha/databases/bsidesnrb.db
```
we use sqlite 3 to get the second flag
```bash
b3nj4h@arch > sqlite3 bsidesnrb.db
SQLite version 3.43.2 2023-10-10 12:14:04
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .tables
android_metadata  flag            
sqlite> select * from flag
   ...> ;
1|flag2|_db_m1sc0nf1gs
sqlite> 
```
We navigate to sharedPrefsActivity and find this

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/9.png)

We decode the string and get the third part of the flag
```bash
b3nj4h@arch ~> echo XzRyM19kNG5nM3IwdXNzc30= | base64 -d
_4r3_d4ng3r0usss}
```
We now have the full flag
```
BSidesNBI{4ndro1d_db_m1sc0nf1gs_4r3_d4ng3r0usss}
```
### WatchDog
#### First method
We get this if statement in the decompiled code. Let's try changing it in the smali code to bypass the check

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/11.png)

decompile the app with apk tool
```bash
apktool d watchdog.apk
```
From the decompiled app we know the package and the class

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/12.png)

We navigate to smali > d > b.smali and locate the if statement

```bash
    .line 15
    .line 16
    const/4 v1, 0x0

    .line 17
    if-eqz p1, :cond_0

    .line 18
    .line 19
    const-string p1, "You cannot move right now, the light is red!!"

    .line 20
    .line 21
    invoke-static {v3, p1, v1}, Landroid/widget/Toast;->makeText(Landroid/content/Context;Ljava/lang/CharSequence;I)Landroid/widget/Toast;

    .line 22
    .line 23
    .line 24
    move-result-object p1
```

We change the if-eqz to if-nez 
```bash
    .line 17
    if-nez p1, :cond_0
```
We need to change extractNativeLibs to true in the manifest file to avoid any installation errors
```bash
android:extractNativeLibs="true"
```
Let's compile the apk again
```bash
apktool b watchdog
I: Using Apktool 2.8.1-dirty
I: Checking whether sources has changed...
I: Checking whether resources has changed...
I: Building resources...
I: Building apk file...
I: Copying unknown files/dir...
I: Built apk into: watchdog/dist/watchdog.apk
```
Next we need to sign the apk. Let's navigate to the location of the apk file
```bash
cd watchdog/dist/
```
We then generate a key
```bash
keytool -genkey -keystore whoami.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 1000
-alias whoami
Enter keystore password:  
Re-enter new password: 
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  
Is CN=Unknown, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown correct?
  [no]:  yes

Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA256withRSA) with a validity of 1,000 days
	for: CN=Unknown, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown
```
Lastly we sign our apk
```bash
jarsigner -keystore whoami.keystore -verbose watchdog.apk whoami
```
Make sure you get this at the end
```bash
>>> Signer
    X.509, CN=Unknown, OU=Unknown, O=Unknown, L=Unknown, ST=Unknown, C=Unknown
    Signature algorithm: SHA256withRSA, 2048-bit key
    [trusted certificate]

jar signed.

Warning: 
The signer's certificate is self-signed.
```
We unistall the old apk and install the new one
```bash
adb uninstall watchdog.apk
adb install watchdog.apk
```
We open the app and click the button. Finally we get the flag

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/13.png)

#### Second method
We can use frida script to change the true variable to false using a custom script Thanks to madbit for the script 
```javascript
Java.perform(function () {
    var MainActivity = Java.use('com.bsidesnrb.watchdog.MainActivity');

    // Hook the onCreate method of MainActivity
    MainActivity.onCreate.overload('android.os.Bundle').implementation = function (bundle) {
        // Call the original onCreate method
        this.onCreate(bundle);

        // Attempt to modify the field directly, handle the case where the field might be obfuscated
        try {
            var f = MainActivity.class.getDeclaredField('f1258t');
            f.setAccessible(true);
            f.setBoolean(this, false);
            console.log('Field f1258t set to false successfully.');
        } catch (e) {
            console.log('Field f1258t not found. Attempting to find the obfuscated field name.');

            // If the field name is obfuscated, you might need to iterate over all fields and find the correct one by type
            var fields = MainActivity.class.getDeclaredFields();
            for (var i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) {
                var field = fields[i];
                if (field.getType().getName() === 'boolean') {
                    field.setAccessible(true);
                    field.setBoolean(this, false);
                    console.log('Field name: ' + field.getName() + ', Type: ' + field.getType().getName());
                    console.log('Obfuscated boolean field set to false successfully. Field name: ' + field.getName());
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    };
});
```
We use frida to change the boolean to false
```bash
frida -l bypass -f com.bsidesnrb.watchdog -U

```
We click move and we get the flag

### Whatslif3
Thou shall find what made him one with the world.
#### This took us out? (75pts) 
From the source code we see that the input should be a base64 decoded string check_guess
![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/3.png)
We get the string from resources and base64 decode it
```bash
b3nj4h@arch ~> echo QlNpZGVzTkJJe3RoaXNfZGlkbid0X2tpbGxfdGhlbX0= | base64 -d
BSidesNBI{this_didn't_kill_them}
```
We use the output as our input string and hit the submit button. We get the activity with this encoded string

![img-description](/assets/img/bsides2023/2.png)

We take the string and slap it in cyber chef and wait for it to do the magic. Boom there we go we get the flag `BSidesNRB{c4r3full_hubr1s_w1ll_t4k3_us_0u7}`
